1)When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

When I want to change my project in other PCs, or if I'm working on a 
open source project.

2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If I am working on a ope-source project, maybe I want to have a 
different code than the original one. Considering that I am not the 
owner of the repository.

3)Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?


Forks: to clone someones repository on github.

Branches: to do a ramification from the master project.

Clone: to copy the github repository to my machine, or to clone a local 
repository to another "folder"
