1)What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I need to commit the repository, because when I initialize it it won't 
do any commit for me.
Pay attention to git init and git status.

2)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

I can manage my commits with multiple files putting them on the staging 
area, to do a better logical commit. I can also commit all the changed 
files at once, after I modified the ones I needed.
